industry-specific events, or economic situations may also have an impact on variations in invoice counts. For instance, Mother's Day or the end of the school year may fall in May or June, when sales activity is expected to be higher.Businesses may more effectively manage inventory levels, staffing, and marketing strategies when they have a clear understanding of the monthly changes in sales activity.
