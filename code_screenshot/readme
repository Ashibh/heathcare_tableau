# Here, the Sales dataset is analyzed using SQL. Below are the steps followed to analyze insights from the data: 

- A new database named "online_sales" has been created and then all records from the "online_retail" table are retreived.

- Then missing values and duplicates are handled from the dataset.Checks for missing values in critical columns
(e.g InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country) and
Identification of the duplicate rows is done.

- Customer Analysis is done by calculating metrics such as the number of invoices per customer, number of unique
customers in each country, average quantity of items purchased per invoice by each customer, and identifies the 
top 10 customers by total spending.

- Product Analysis identifies top-selling products by quantity and revenue. Calculations for the average unit price
of items sold is done here.


- Invoice Analysis examines the distribution of invoice quantities. It analyzes trends in the number of invoices over
time and calculates the average invoice value change over time.
